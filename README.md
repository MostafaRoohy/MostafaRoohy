### 🤖 📈 Machine Learning Professional & Algorithmic Trader
I'm a machine learning professional who loves solving real-world problems—especially in the world of finance. I focus on building practical ML solutions with predictive modeling, time series forecasting, and classification/regression.

Along the way, I also build and fine-tune algorithmic trading strategies using Python and MQL5. I developed deep experience converting strategies and code between Python, MQL5, and Pine Script, helping bridge the gap across platforms and tools.
